      <h2>Where Every Step Resonates Green</h2>
      <p>
        EchoTerra is a sustainable tour company dedicated to reimagining the way people travel.
        Our name reflects our belief that every journey sends an echo through the Earth, and we
        want that echo to be gentle, responsible and green.
      </p>
      <p>
        We design curated eco‑tours that balance discovery with protection: discovering new
        landscapes, cultures and stories, while protecting the ecosystems and communities
        that make each destination unique.

      <h2>Our Mission ➤</h2>
      <p>
        EchoTerra’s mission is to raise awareness and actively reduce unsustainable tourism habits.
        We create journeys that respect local cultures, protect natural habitats and inspire people
        to travel more consciously.
      </p>

        By combining thoughtful planning, transparent practices and clear guidance, we help our guests
        make choices that are kinder to the planet, without losing the joy of exploration.

      <h2>Our Vision ✦</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision is a world where every trip leaves a positive trace: cleaner trails, stronger
        communities and more travellers who understand their impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        EchoTerra strives to make sustainable tourism the new standard, where “green” is not a niche
        option but the natural way to experience the Earth’s most beautiful places.
